# RootMail
Intranet email app designed for office use.
<br>
<br>
<b>Stack Used:</b>  Java, NodeJS
<br>
<br>
<br>
This app is for custom use in the office. As we all know that security is a main concern for every company and no company wants their
emails to get under wrong hands.

So I have made this Intranet mail app which will allow the employees to send mails and files to other employees with their employee code.

Server should be run in a local machine connected to a local wifi

No third person can signup in this app as he/she has to know a company code that is required in the signup process

<b>Users must have java installed in their machine to run the app</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>To run the project: </b>
<br>
Run server.js file in a machine with node installed
<br>
Now go into RootMail.java file and run viv.jar file
<br>
<br>
<br>
